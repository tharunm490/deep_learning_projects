# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project is a **basic Deep Learning implementation** of a **Customer Churn Prediction system** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **TensorFlow and Keras**.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to **leave (churn)** or **stay** based on customer-related features.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is an important problem in many industries such as banking, telecom, and subscription-based services.  
In this project, a simple **ANN model** is trained to classify customers as **churned** or **not churned**.

This project is part of my **Deep Learning learning journey** and focuses on understanding:

- Neural network architecture
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Customer data containing features such as:
  - Customer demographics
  - Account information
  - Service usage details
- Target variable:
  - `Churn` (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

_(Dataset used only for learning purposes)_
